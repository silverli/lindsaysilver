    <p> I made extensive edits to this website's homepage. I also did website maintenance on images that were not responsive, buttons that were not centered, and sticky nav-bars that were not working. Lastly, I created one more grid class (xs) because the default Bootstrap grid sizing was not accomodating what I wanted to do with the feature images on the home page. Please see the video I made below to view the changes I made to the <a href = "http://cope.haverford.edu/"> Cope Evans Site </a></p>
