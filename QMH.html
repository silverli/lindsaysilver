    <p>Backend: Django <br>
    Frontend: Foundation<br>
    Database: Postgresql</p>
    <p> I spent the summer of 2015 making this website alone from the ground-up. Using Django as a backend, I created a substantial administration page which will allow students and librarians to continue to add to the research and information from Special Collections on Friends Asylum.  Additionally, I created the front end of the site with Foundation5 and a few visualizations with D3 and pulling from the PostgreSQL database.  The goal of this site is to be a digital way to learn more about the early years of Friends Asylum, and spur further research projects.  </p>
