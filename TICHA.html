    <h2 class = "text-center"> Ticha: a digital text explorer for Colonial Zapotec </h2>
    <p>Framework: Jekyll <br>
      Front-end: Bootstrap<br>
    Database: Omeka API<br>
  Textual Markup Languages and Text Encoding Standards: XML, XLST, and TEI</p>
    <p> I helped to not only make the entire site more responsive, but also did extensive work with JavaScript and the Omeka API in order to create a new way for users to interact with the available Zapotec manuscripts.  I used DataTables, a jQuery plugin, to display the available metadata, and also allow for easy searching and re-orderering of the information.  The diagram belows gives a bit more detail about what exactly went into Ticha to make the site, and digital exploration of the manuscripts possible.  Also, in the video below, you can view the changes I made to Ticha--the website on the left is the one with my changes, and the one of the right is the original.  </p>
    <p>This website was also the subject of a recent presentation by the Ticha team in Madrid at the Hispanic Digital Humanities Association International Conference (Oct 5-7).  The title of the presentation was: "Archives, morphological analysis, &amp; XML encoding: interdisciplinary methods in the creation of a digital text explorer for Colonial Zapotec manuscripts." </p>
