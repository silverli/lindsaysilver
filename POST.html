    <p>Software: Mac Pages <br>
    </p>
    <p> I created this poster with the mac Pages application to promote the 2015-2016 Digital Scholarship Fellows Program.  The design for this poster was meant to imitate the color scheme for the existing <a href = "http://ds.haverford.edu/dsfellows/">website</a> for the DS Fellows Program, while also being informational and spark interest in the program.  Click on the photo to view the full pdf of the poster.  </p>
